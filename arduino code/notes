The selected TTGO ESP32 is Arduino compatible, as such the Arduino IDE is used to code the ESP32 micro-controller. This decision is made due to the abundance of resources and libraries available to assist in fulfilling the goals of the ESP32 measurement and communication strategy. The micro-controller is programmed for the following functionality: Create and establish Bluetooth connection and communication with a device; Measurements of ADC pins; Writing to digital pins to control switching circuitry; Obtain temperature readings from BME280 and Display instructions and measurements to user on OLED display.
