The selected TTGO ESP32 is Arduino compatible, as such the Arduino IDE is used to code the ESP32 micro-controller. 
This decision is made due to the abundance of resources and libraries available to assist in fulfilling the goals of the ESP32 measurement and communication strategy. 
The micro-controller is programmed for the following functionality: 
Create and establish Bluetooth connection and communication with a device; 
Measurements of ADC pins; 
Writing to digital pins to control switching circuitry; 
Obtain temperature readings from BME280 and 
Display instructions and measurements to user on OLED display.
