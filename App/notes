Android Studio's Flutter extension is used to develop the App. Flutter uses Dart as its programming language.
The app allows the user to: 
- view live measured voltage, current, temperature and light intensity
- visualise the voltage and current measurements in their own respective refreshable line charts
- visualise the IV curve 
- visualise the IV curve scaled back to STC
- once the IV curve has been traced, the measurements are saved to a CSV file in the phone's internal storage to allow the user to access the data at a later stage

The skeleton of the code used to create the app is achieved with reference to:
- Paul DeMarco's example code (https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue/tree/master/example), 
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6jo2kJanqU&t=1406s) and 
- (https://github.com/0015/IdeasNProjects/tree/master/Esp32_dust_sensor_ble_FLUTTER/). 
These references are used to assist in creating 'main.dart', 'widget.dart' and 'sensor\_page.dart'. 
At its basis, these files establish the visuals, Bluetooth connection and communication of measurements. 

The functionality of the app thereafter was created with assistance from the associated pub.dev websites for each of the packages used. 
VoltageChart.dart, CurrentChart.dart, VCChart.dart and stc\_iv.dart are created with help from a charts\_flutter pub.dev example project.
Flutter packages used for this project:
- flutter_blue
- light
- charts_flutter
- csv
- ext_storage
