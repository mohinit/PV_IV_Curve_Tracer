# PV_IV_Curve_Tracer
Final year BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering Project Repository. 
Project Title: PV Module I-V Curve Tracer.
Project Description: Design, simulate, build and test a handheld I-V curve tracer (with accompanying software) for a single PV module, using capacitive loading, that reports the measured results to an Android phone.
Contents of this repository includes the Arduino IDE code used to program the chosen TTGO ESP32 + OLED Display micro-controller and the Flutter App lib files used for the reporting of the measurements taken. The App was made using Android Studio's Flutter Extension.
